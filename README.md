# Hierarchical-Modeling

This is a collection of my work from the Multilevel and Hieracharical Models class I took in fall of 2022. This is a graduate level course offered by Duke's Statistical Science department. The coursework includes four homework assignments, as well as two case studies. All work was completed independently. A course description can be found below:

Course Description: Variance component models with fixed and random effects. Multilevel and hierarchical models for longitudinal and/or clustered data. Focus on model fitting and interpretation. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference and computation.
